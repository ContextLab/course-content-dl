# Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning (NMA-DL) syllabus

*July 10-28, 2023*

**Objectives**: Gain hands-on, code-first experience with deep learning theories, models, and skills that are useful for applications and for advancing science. We focus on how to decide which problems can be tackled with deep learning, how to determine what model is best, how to best implement a model, how to visualize / justify findings, and how neuroscience can inspire deep learning. And throughout we emphasize the ethical use of DL. 

Please check out [expected prerequisites here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/precourse/blob/main/prereqs/DeepLearning.md)!

**The content should primarily be accessed from our ebook: https://contextlab.github.io/course-content-dl/tutorials/intro.html [under continuous development]**

**Schedule for 2023: https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content-dl/blob/main/tutorials/Schedule/daily_schedules.md**

This version of the Neuromatch course incorporates [Chatify](https://github.com/ContextLab/chatify) ðŸ¤– functionality. This is an experimental extension that adds support for a large language model-based helper to the some of the tutorial materials. Instructions for using the Chatify extension are provided in the relevant tutorial notebooks.  Note that using the extension may cause breaking changes and/or provide incorrect or misleading information.

Thanks for giving Chatify a try! Love it? Hate it? Either way, we'd love to hear from you about your Chatify experience!  Please consider filling out our [brief survey](https://forms.gle/jNq85KVvNwj1JHZV9) to provide feedback and help us make Chatify more awesome!
